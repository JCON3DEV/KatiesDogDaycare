  <section class="about">
    <p>I have looked after clients dogs for the last 10 years and I absolutely
      love what I do and like to help clients as much as I can by making sure
      I am available and flexible to their requirements and ensuring their dogs
      are happy and well looked after and exercised.</p>
    <p>The dogs love coming to me and when many owners tell their dogs they are
      going to "Katie's the dogs sit and wait by the front door waiting for me!
      Hence the name" Katies"!</p>
    <p>I offer daycare so always have several dogs that travel and walk all
      together as a pack, which the dogs love as lots of playmates and social
      interaction and because they are well exercised together they all sleep
      well too!</p>

  <section class="hours">
    <p>I am available 7 days a week 52 weeks of the year including Christmas
